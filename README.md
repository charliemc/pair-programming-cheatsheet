# Pair Programming Cheatsheet

The content of this cheatsheet was gathered and distilled from the **awesome** [Tuple’s Pair Programming Guide](https://tuple.app/pair-programming-guide/).

## Ergonomics

- Sit directly next to each other, with the monitor equidistant between you.
- Plug in one keyboard per person.
- Use an editor/IDE that you both know reasonably well.
- Bump up the text size a little.

## Eliminate distractions

- Don’t bring your phone. Silence it if you do.
- Disable notifications on the machine you’re using to pair.
- Close email/Slack/Twitter/IRC. Never keep something distracting on a second monitor.

## Work

- **Pairing should involve constant two-way communication.**
- When navigating: ask questions rather than making demands.
- When driving: dictate what you’re doing and why.
- Take lots of breaks.
- Swap roles frequently.

Unless you already know what works best for you, try the Pomodoro Technique:

- Code for 25 minutes.
- Take a 5 minute break.
- Switch drivers.

## Driver/Navigator

Probably the most common type of pairing.

The **driver** types the code and stays focused on the current task.

The **navigator** thinks ahead, ponders edge cases, spots bugs, suggests refactorings, asks good questions, stays zoomed out.

### Driver

- Unless you’re sure your pair is keeping up, don’t manipulate code quite as fast as you’re able.
- If you get the sense that your pair’s attention is drifting, stop and sync up.
- Ask good questions: _"Which part of this is hardest to follow?”_ vs bad questions: _“You understand this, right?”_
- If your navigator is making a suggestion, consider taking your hands off the keyboard. Even better: turn and make eye contact.

### Navigator

- Give your driver a chance to notice their own syntax errors and typos.
- If you have a suggestion for the driver, communicate it at the highest level of abstraction they’ll understand.
- If you find yourself dictating code (or worse, individual keystrokes), stop and see if you can communicate your idea at a higher level.

## Perform a mini retro

Spend a few minutes after your session reflecting on the experience.

First, discuss what went well.

Then, consider what would make the next session 1% better.

Possible areas for improvement:

- **Focus**: did distractions sneak in?
- **Communication**: were there long stretches of no talking?
- **Pacing**: did the session feel like a grind at any point?
- **Division of responsibility**: did you split the work up well?
- **Code quality**: was your end-product high-quality?
